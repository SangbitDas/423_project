üöÄ Endless Runner 3D (PyOpenGL)

A simple 3D endless runner game written in Python with PyOpenGL and GLUT.
The player runs along a road, dodging obstacles, collecting coins, and picking up power-ups like magnets and a hoverboard.

Features include jumping, sliding, hoverboard mode, first-person/third-person camera toggle, and an  enemy chaser.

üéÆ Features

1. Endless Forward Movement ‚Äì The player moves forward automatically in a lane, creating an endless runner experience.

2. Lane Switching & Player Movement ‚Äì Move left or right between lanes, jump over obstacles, or slide under low barriers, with simple running/jumping animations.

3. Obstacle Spawning ‚Äì Randomly generate obstacles in lanes; collision with obstacles reduces player life.

4. Collectibles & Score System ‚Äì Coins, gems, or items appear along the track; collecting them increases score, which also considers distance traveled.

5. Life System & Restart Option ‚Äì Player has a limited number of lives; collisions reduce life, and the game can be restarted without closing the window.

6. Speed Scaling ‚Äì Forward movement speed gradually increases, providing progressively higher difficulty.

7. Power-Ups ‚Äì Temporary boosts like shield (invincibility), magnet (auto-collect), or double score appear along the track.


8. Dynamic Camera System ‚Äì Smoothly follows the player; allows adjustable views and first-person perspective for immersive gameplay.

9. Visual Feedback & HUD ‚Äì Display current score, remaining lives, and collected power-ups on screen using on-screen text.

10. Invisible Enemy Chase ‚Äì An enemy is always chasing the player but not shown on screen. If the player makes a mistake (collision or missed jump/slide), the enemy closes in for 5 seconds, increasing pressure and risk of losing.


11. Multiple Levels ‚Äì The game has two distinct levels:
Level 1: Player moves normally with the vehicle.


Level 2: Player moves in a cart, introducing different handling, speed, and movement style for variety
